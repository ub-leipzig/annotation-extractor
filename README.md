Annotation-Extractor
=======

A simple tool to extract JSON-LD OA annotations stored in a SQLite database produced by [Mirador-SUL](https://github.com/ub-leipzig/mirador_sul).

The tool also converts these annotations into N3 so that the graphs can put into a triplestore for SPARQL queries.

The output file is located at `de/ubleipzig/extractor/annotations.n3`
